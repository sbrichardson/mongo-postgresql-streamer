mongo-postgresql-streamer is used to make the bridge between PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
It acts as a river from MongoDB to PostgreSQL and is a direct

This connector is the successor of `PG Mongo Connector <https://github.com/Maltcommunity/mongo-connector-postgresql>`__.

# System Overview and prerequisites


`mongo-postgresql-streamer` creates a pipeline from a MongoDB cluster to PostgreSQL. It synchronizes data in MongoDB
to the target then tails the MongoDB oplog, keeping up with operations in MongoDB in real-time. It has been tested with
Java 8 and PostgreSQL 9.5.

# Getting Started


For some context (in french) : [See our blog article ](https://medium.com/nerds-malt/business-intelligence-sur-mongodb-de-mongo-%C3%A0-postgresql-%C3%A0-chartio-ddc9e2f561ef/)

## Installation


To install mongo-postresql-streamer:
- clone the repository
- compile the application with
```
    mvn install
``` 
- the executable is located in the target folder. You can run it with the following command
```
    java -jar target/mongo-postgresql-streamer*.jar
```
That's all. But of course you'll need to override some configurations and we will explain it in the next sections.

## Using this connector

If you want to override configurations, you can pass arguments like this:
```
  java -jar target/mongo-postgresql-streamer*.jar --mongo.connector.identifier=members --mappings=mappings-members.json --server.port=8089
```

Alternatively, you can use a configuration file (in yml or properties format) like this 

```
  java -jar -Dspring.config.location=<path-to-file> target/mongo-postgresql-streamer*.jar 
```

## Options

|Option   | Default value   | description  |
|---|---|---|
|mongo.admin.database   | test   | The database where the connector store a checkpoint to remember the last oplog that was already processed|
|spring.datasource.url | jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432 | the jdbc url to connect to postgresql |
|spring.datasource.username |  | username to login on pgsql |
|spring.datasource.password | | I think you already know what is this field |
|mongo.connector.identifier | streamer | if you have different connectors, use different identifiers so that they don't have conflicts in the mongooplog collection  |
|mongo.connector.forcereimport | false | Use this argument if you want to force a new reimport of your schema and data  |
|mappings | mappings.json | The path to your mapping file |
|mongo.uri | mongodb://localhost:27017 | The connection url to your mongodb database |
 
 This option's list is not exhaustive.
 

## Mapping file

This connector use its own mapping file to determine the fields that should be written in PostgreSQL and their types.
This file should be named mappings.json. Here is a sample :

```

    {
        "my_mongo_database":{
            "my_mongo_collection":{
                "pk":"id",
                "indices":[
                    "UNIQUE INDEX subproperty_idx ON my_postgre_table(subproperty)"
                ],
                "_id":{
                    "dest":"id",
                    "type":"TEXT"
                },
                "description":{
                    "type":"TEXT",
                    "index": true,
                },
                "enable":{
                    "dest":"enabled",
                    "type":"BOOLEAN"
                },
                "myobject.subproperty":{
                    "dest":"subproperty",
                    "type":"TEXT"
                },
                "propertyWhichMayBeNull": {
                    "dest":"property_has_been_provided",
                    "type":"_PRESENCE"
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
Please notice the following :

- The ``pk`` field is mandatory and should point to the destination's primary key
- By default, the ``dest`` field is set to the original Mongo field name.
- If the original document in mongodb has a embedded document, everything is flattened to be inserted in PostgreSQL
- One can define indices in two different ways : Using the array ``indices`` and a SQL definition or autogenerate index
 by setting the ``index`` field to true

The connector also supports arrays of documents. Let say your Mongo database stores the following documents :

```

    {
        "posts":{
            "name":"Check out the mongo -> postgres connector",
            "content":"Inspiring blog post",
            "comments":[
                {
                    "user":"Elon Musk",
                    "comment":"What a revolution !"
                },
                {
                    "user":"Kevin P. Ryan",
                    "comment":"Nice !"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
```
To allow the connector to map the post objects AND its comments, you should use the following mapping :

```

    {
        "my_mongo_database":{
            "posts":{
                "pk":"id",
                "_id":{
                    "dest":"id",
                    "type":"TEXT"
                },
                "content":{
                    "type":"TEXT"
                },
                "comments":{
                    "type":"_ARRAY",
                    "fk":"post_id"
                }
            },
            "comments":{
                "pk":"id",
                "post_id":{
                    "dest":"post_id",
                    "type":"TEXT"
                },
                "user":{
                    "dest":"user",
                    "type":"TEXT"
                },
                "comment":{
                    "dest":"comment",
                    "type":"TEXT"
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
Please notice the following :

- The type ``_ARRAY`` is used to indicate to the connector that the field is an array
- The additional field ``fk`` is provided to indicate to the connector where to store the root document id. This field is mandatory for an array
- The comments' mapping declares only the primary key but no mapping exists. The connector will generate the identifier automatically
- The foreign key must be declared in the comments table so it's created with the schema initialization

Finally, the connector supports arrays of scalar. Let say your Mongo database stores the following documents in the ``timeline`` collection :

```

    {
    	"author": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    	"posts": [{
    		"name": "Check out the mongo -> postgres connector",
    		"tags": [
    			"Awesome",
    			"Article",
    			"Postgres"
    		]
    	}]
    }
```
One can use the following mapping :

```

    {
    	"my_mongo_database": {
    		"timeline": {
    			"pk": "id",
    			"_id": {
    				"dest": "id",
    				"type": "TEXT"
    			},
    			"author": {
    				"type": "TEXT"
    			},
    			"posts": {
    				"type": "_ARRAY",
    				"dest": "timeline_posts",
    				"fk": "timeline_id"
    			}
    		},
    		"timeline_posts": {
    			"pk": "id",
    			"_id": {
    				"dest": "id",
    				"type": "TEXT"
    			},
    			"name": {
    				"type": "TEXT"
    			},
    			"tags": {
    				"dest": "timeline_posts_tags",
    				"type": "_ARRAY_OF_SCALARS",
    				"fk": "timeline_post_id",
    				"valueField": "tag"
    			}
    		},
    		"timeline_posts_tags": {
    			"pk": "id",
    			"_id": {
    				"dest": "id",
    				"type": "TEXT"
    			},
    			"tag": {
    				"type": "TEXT"
    			}
    		}
    	}
    }
```
Contribution / Limitations
--------------------------

We searched for a software like this for quiet a time and we are confident that other people would need it.
However, some features/improvements are currently lacking :

- A better documentation ?
- You can't map a mongo collection to a differently named postgres table (we didn't have this usage)
- Rollbacks are not supported
- System commands are not supported (e.g. create collection)
- Because of our use of the ON CONFLICT directive, only PostgreSQL >= 9.5 can be used

Even if this code is battle tested (we use it in production and fix for bugs every time we see one), it is far from
perfect.
